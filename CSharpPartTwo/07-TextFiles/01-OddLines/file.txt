I am a man who walks alone 
And when I'm walking a dark road 
At night or strolling through the park 

When the light begins to change 
I sometimes feel a little strange 
A little anxious when it's dark 

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
I have a constant fear that something's 
Always near 
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
I have a phobia that someone's 
Always there 

Have you run your fingers down 
The wall 
And have you felt your neck skin crawl 
When you're searching for the light? 
Sometimes when you're scared 
To take a look 
At the corner of the room 
You've sensed that something's 
Watching you 

Have you ever been alone at night 
Thought you heard footsteps behind 
And turned around and no one's there? 
And as you quicken up your pace 
You find it hard to look again 
Because you're sure there's 
Someone there 

Watching horror films the night before 
Debating witches and folklore 
The unknown troubles on your mind 
Maybe your mind is playing tricks 
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix 
On dancing shadows from behind 

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
I have constant fear that something's 
Always near 
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark 
I have a phobia that someone's 
Always there 

When I'm walking a dark road 
I am a man who walks alone
